# CP4WAIOps Sandbox

This repository is used as a sandbox to demonstrate the deployment of Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps(CP4WAIOps), sample application, and other dependencies using GitOps.
It relies on [CP4WAIOps GitOps](https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-gitops) repository which hosts all official deployment configuration in order to deploy CP4WAIOps using GitOps with profile from small, medium, to large.

Demos:
* [Deploy CP4WAIOps Demo Environment In One Click Using GitOps](docs/gitops-deploy-cp4waiops-demo.md)
* [Deploy CP4WAIOps Demo Environment to Multiple Clusters Using GitOps](docs/gitops-deploy-cp4waiops-multi-cluster.md)
* [Deploy CP4WAIOps Demo Environment With OpenShift Cluster Using GitOps](docs/gitops-deploy-cp4waiops-with-ocp.md)
